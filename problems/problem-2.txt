Environment action group Recycle-To-Win (RTW) are committed to lobbying the Government to improve recycling rates. 
Their current priority is based on the EU target for the UK to recycle at least 50% of waste generated by households by 2020. 
The team have been commissioned to investigate of the following:
	
- household waste and recycling rates in the last few years for each local authority
	
- identify which boroughs are on track to hit this target, as well as the UK as a whole,

- they would like an interactive tool that allows comparison of a chosen local authority against other nearby authorities, and against the best and the worst nationally.
