Be-Oh-lia, a multinational waste and recycling management firm, are looking to expand their operations to England. 
They have commissioned the team to investigate the following: 

- report on waste and recycling rates in different local authorities, to identify potential sites for pilot expansion,
- data quality - identifying any big shifts that are not explainable (e.g. increase in landfill tonnages over the years with no obvious reason why),
- postcode outward code mapping to identify potential correlates (e.g. population, socio-economic groupings, income),
- Identify recommendations for additional data required.
