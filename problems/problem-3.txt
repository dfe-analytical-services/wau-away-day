Experts in the field of all things proper, Australian etiquette-coaching company DeeBret’s have been asked by a local magazine 
to write an article ‘DeeBret’s Guide to Pets’. What pets are in vogue? What should you (and more importantly should you not) 
name your pet? When adopting a Labrador, should one opt for Golden or Chocolate?

The research team have obtained a list of registered cat and dog names from the Sunshine Coast Council. 
It is your task to analyse this dataset and summarize your findings so that the writing team can consider 
what to include in the dogs & cats chapter of their Guide to Pets.
