Australia’s National Association of Veterinary Administrators (ANAVA) suffered some bad press recently, 
after two Jack Russell’s named Jack were patients at the same veterinary practice on the same weekend. 
In the confusion, the wrong Jack had his hip replaced.

In response to the incident, ANAVA would like to investigate the prevalence of common pet names to understand 
the risk of such a mistake occurring again. They have obtained a list of registered dog and cat names from the Sunshine Coast Council.
It is your task to analyse this dataset and summarize your findings to report back to the Association.
